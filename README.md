# Neural Network Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a feedforward neural network from scratch using NumPy to classify binary 5x6 image representations of letters A, B, and C.

## Features
- Manual weight initialization
- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation
- Loss tracking
- Visualization using matplotlib

## Output
- Final accuracy
- Training loss graph
- Predicted image output using imshow()

## How to Run
1. Open `neural_network_classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells.
3. Output will show prediction and images.
